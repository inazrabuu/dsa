## Backtracking
- Backtracking is **DFS with undo steps**
- Explore all possibilities, and if path doesn't work, "backtrack" and try another one
- Trigger words: "All combinations", "All permutations", "Subsets", "Word search in grid", 'N-Queens". If we see "generate all possibilities" -> backtracking.

### Hook:
>"Walking through a maze: try a path, mark it, if it's wrong, step back and try another one"
>- **DFS**: just goes deep
>- **Backtrack**: goes deep AND has an "undo" step (`pop`)
