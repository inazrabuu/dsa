## Two Pointers (Fixed direction until meet)
- Use two indices to shrink or expand a window while moving toward each other or in the same direction
- Trigger words: "sorted array", "pair sum", "container", "intersection"

### Hook:
> "Two archers on a line - if the arrow is two short, move left forward, if too long, move right backward"
- Visualize `left` and `right` standing at both ends of a sorted array, adjusting until they meet the target

## Sliding Window (Elastic movement)
- Use a dynamic "window" to track a substring or subarray, expanding or shrinking it based on constraints
- Trigger words: "longest", "substring", "subarray", "no repeat"

### Hook:
> "A window sliding over a string - shrink if it breaks, expand if it fits"
- Visualise a window expanding right to inlcude characters and shrinking left to remove duplicates or excess
