# DSA

A practice / playground to understand Data Structure & Algorithm.

## Keyword → Pattern
| Pattern | Trigger Keyword | Hook |
| ------- | --------------- | ---- |
| [Two Pointers](./iterations/) | "Pair", "Closest", "Water", "Sorted Array", "Palindrome" | "Two runners from both ends racing towards each other" |
| [Sliding Window](./iterations/) | "Substring", "Subarray", "Window", "Minimum / Maximum Length" | "Move a window along the string / array until it fits" |
| [Fast & Slow Pointers](./iterations/) | "Linked list", "Cycle", "Middle", "Detect Loop" | "One runner fast, one runner slow, if there is a loop, they meet" |
| [Hashmap (Frequency)](./frequency/) | "Anagram", "Frequency", "Count", "Duplicate", "Group" | "Count stuff in a bucket (hash) |
| [Stack](./stack/) | "Parentheses", "Evaluate", "Monotonic", "Previous / Next greater" | "Stack of plates: push until rules pop" |
| [DFS / BFS](./traversal/) | "Islands", "Connected", "Shortest path", "Rotting" | "DFS dives deep, BFS spreads like a wave" |
| [Backtracking](./backtracking/) | "Permutations", "Combinations", "Subsets", "Solve sudoku" | "Try, undo, try another, fitting room" |
| [Binary Search on Answer](./binary-search/) | "Find minimum of X", "Capacity", "Speed", "Peak", "Koko" | "Guess the answer, check feasibility, shrink range" |

## Quick Pull Up
- Pairs & sorted? → Two Pointers
- Window length or substring? → Sliding Window
- Linked List? → Fast & Slow
- Count/group things? → HashMap
- Undo moves? → Backtracking
- Spread or traverse levels? → BFS/DFS
- Stack-like behavior? → Stack
- "Minimum X such that..."? → Binary Search on Answer
