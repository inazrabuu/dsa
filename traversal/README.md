## D|BFS
- DFS (Depth First Search): Go as deep as possible before backtracking
- BFS (Breadth First Search): Explore all neighbors level by level
- Both are used for trees, graphs and grid problems
- Trigger words: "Tree traversal", "level order", "shortest path in unweighted graph", "connected components", "grid islands (flood fill)". If we see "level" or "shortest path" -> BFS, if we see "search until the end" or "all combinations" -> DFS

### Hook:
>- DFS: "Dive into the cave, go as far as you can, then backtrack"
>- BFS: "Sweep the cave level by level with a flashlight"
